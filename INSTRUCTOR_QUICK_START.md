## Best Practices from Music Educators

### "Make it Musical"
Don't just teach theory in isolation. Constantly connect concepts to real music students know and love.

### "Listen, Then Learn"
Start each module with listening examples before diving into technical details.

### "Practice Makes Perfect"
Theory requires repetition. Encourage daily 15-minute practice sessions over cramming.

### "Apply Immediately"
Have students analyze or compose using new concepts right away to reinforce learning.

### "Build a Community"
Create a collaborative environment where students help each other learn difficult concepts.
